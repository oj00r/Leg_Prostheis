<h1>Leg Prosthesis</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
During my bachelor studies, we had to prepare a simple object in Creo. Since I became fluent with the software, I prepared something more advanced related to the study programme Biomedical Engineering. The following leg prosthesis is a combination of the two articles that i have linked below.

<h2>Software</h2>

- <b>Creo Parametric</b>

Samples’ weights were analyzed before and after etching (- look Fig 2.), as well as their compression strength. Figure 3 shows an exemplary results of compression test, highlighting the region of plastic deformation, which is unwated in human implants.


<h2>Summary</h2>

Doing the thesis on 3D printing introduced me to problems that can occur at every step of manufacturing a product, no matter if it is very popular or niche. In this project, I was able to determine near-optimal conditions, though challenges like particles trapped inside the porous structure remain.

I also gained insight into the wide variety of tests and material properties available with current state-of-the-art technology. Overall, I am very glad to have experienced engineering problem worked under a cooperation with scietits at my univeristy, which can only my perspecitve in solving real-world problems :).
