<h1>Leg Prosthesis</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
During my bachelor studies, we had to prepare a simple object in Creo. Since I became briefly fluent with the software, I prepared something more advanced related to the study programme Biomedical Engineering. The following leg prosthesis is a combination of the two articles that i have linked below.

<h2>Software</h2>

- <b>Creo Parametric</b>

<h2>Summary</h2>

According to the supervisor of my project: “So now what? Time to print!” Unfortunately, the lack of a 3D printer at that time was the only thing that stopped me. However, I gained experience in projects that are larger and more complex than just a simple bolt. 

All in all, I am happy with the results, especially for my first project in CAD software. If I were to continue the project, i would perform adhere to avaible ISO norms and apply metric of bolts and holes accoridngly to european market.
